### Analysis of Vehicle Performance and Characteristics in the “Dakar Desert Rally”
This document is part of my final project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, offered by Google through the Coursera platform. The goal of this project is to analyze the performance and characteristics of vehicles in the game “Dakar Desert Rally”, using detailed data to identify which vehicles perform best and how these characteristics influence the price and choice of players.
